        <h1>Welcome To our Memory Game</h1>
        <p>
            Our humble version of the classic memory game consists of 8 pairs of cards,
            when you flip a card you flip another card and if they match they become unclikcable and
            the front face of both cards become permenantly visible unless you reresh the page.
            if the second card doesn't match they flip back and both cards become clickable again.
            once you get all cards all matched up then that's it buddy you won.
            pretty straight forward don't you think?
